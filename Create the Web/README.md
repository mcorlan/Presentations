Keynote

- Welcome to Create the Web
- I am Kevin Hoyt and this is Terry Ryan
- Today we're going to talk about web standards, expression and tools
- In the past things were easy - one screen and two browsers
- With device and browser explosion, we have a complexity explosion
- Adobe has seen this first hand - CCM is built with web standards (responsive)
- And we've been working on the W3C Working Groups and WebKit open source project
- Our areas of focus have been advanced layout and cinematic and graphical effects
- This isn't smoke and mirror - CSS Filters are in iOS6 today
- To conquer this complexity, you need tools - and we make them
- The modern web needs modern tools, and we've been working on that for over a year
- We recently announced the Adobe Edge Creative Tools and Services
- These are optimized for mobile, task focused, improve productivity
- Adobe Edge Animate is for creating animation with browser content
- Adobe Edge Inspect keeps content in sync across devices and more
- Sometimes you want to deploy and application and for that there's PhoneGap
- The PhoneGap SDK has seen immense success having been download over a million times
- It is also used broadly by well known brands
- Adobe PhoneGap Build allows you to package in the cloud - no IDE needed
- We've been talking quietly about Brackets for a few months now
- This web-centric code editor is available on GitHub
- Adobe Edge Code is an Adobe distribution with hooks to Adobe services
- With TypeKit we continue to work towards our goal of ubiquity for web fonts
- With Adobe Edge Web Fonts, thanks to Google, you have no reason not to use them
- Adobe Edge Reflow enables the delivery of responsive design
- Altogether these represent Adobe Edge Tools and Services
- You might be wondering, where do you get all this goodness?
- You can get them now as part of your Creative Cloud subscription
- If you don't have a subscription, there's now a free tier that includes Edge
- Now go forward and create the web

Fonts

- In 2011, Adobe acquired Typekit for Web Fonts - how is that going?
- Twenty years ago, this is what the web looked like
- Along came the font tag which gave us rudimentary control
- The addition of CSS gave us more control, but limited font options
- Seed Conference in 2008 introduced the concept of downloadable fonts
- The foundries were focused on licensing, which gave rise to Typekit
- Now you can find Web Fonts in use across various types of content
- From visually creative and high design, to traditional print media
- Sites such as New York Times and The New Yorker
- You can even find Web Fonts in use on traditional corporate sites
- On the whole, 1.5 million web sites use Web Fonts, with over 8 billion views
- And Typekit now includes more than 1,200 font families from 53 foundries
- And now we are working with Google to take it even farther
- Adobe Edge Web Fonts include over 500 open source and free fonts
- Along with Google Web Fonts, this also inlcludes several Adobe originals
- We have also introduced Source Sans Pro for use in open source projects
- Source Sans Pro is itself open source and can be downloaded from Adobe's GitHub repository
- For developers we are introducing Source Code Pro for use in your favorite IDE
- Source Code Pro has been designed to avoid character confusion
- No longer will you confused I, with l with the number 1
- The same goes for the capital letter "O" and the number 0
- Like Source San Pro, Source Code Pro can be downloaded from the Adobe GitHub repository
- But we haven't stopped there - we have also signed an agreement with Monotype Imaging
- That is more than 1,000 well-known fonts added to Typekit
- In short - there is simply no reason to not start using Web Fonts today
